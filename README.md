# shacl

A high-performance SHACL validation engine in Rust, targeting full conformance
with the W3C SHACL 1.0 and 1.2 test suites.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/shacl` | The engine library |
| `crates/shacl-cli` | `shacl` command line binary |
| `testsuite/shacl10` | Vendored W3C `data-shapes-test-suite` |
| `testsuite/shacl12` | Vendored W3C `shacl12-test-suite` |

## Design

Three decisions carry most of the performance:

1. **Interned terms.** Every IRI, blank node and literal becomes a `u32` on
   load, so the inner loops compare integers, not strings.
2. **Flat indexes.** A graph is three fully-sorted arrays — `SPO`, `POS`, `OSP`
   — rather than hash maps of adjacency lists. Every lookup SHACL performs is a
   prefix range found by binary search and then walked as contiguous memory.
3. **Compile once.** A shapes graph is compiled into a flat IR before validation
   starts; evaluating a constraint never queries the shapes graph again.

## Conformance

The suites are run by a manifest-driven harness covering both kinds of entry:
`sht:Validate`, which validates a data graph and compares reports, and
`sht:EvalNodeExpr`, which evaluates a node expression and compares the resulting
sequence. Expected and actual reports are compared through one in-memory
representation rather than by diffing serialised RDF; `sh:resultMessage` is
excluded, since the spec leaves message text to the implementation.

**299 of 426** tests pass. The remainder are node expressions: the `shnex-sparql`
group, which exposes the SPARQL function library as node expressions, is not
implemented, and parts of the `shnex` algebra are still missing.

```sh
cargo test -p shacl --test w3c -- --nocapture      # summary
SHACL_TEST_VERBOSE=1 cargo test -p shacl --test w3c -- --nocapture   # per-failure detail
SHACL_TEST_FILTER=core/node cargo test -p shacl --test w3c -- --nocapture
```

`tests/w3c.rs` also holds a `progress` test asserting the pass count never drops
below a recorded baseline.
